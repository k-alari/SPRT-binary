# SPRT for binary data

This applet was designed by Krissi Alari as apart of her senior capstone at Cal State Monterey Bay. This is a modified version of the original applet for this project that is suitable for binary testing. The original version of the applet (for normal data) is available at https://kalari.shinyapps.io/SPRT/ and the code is available at https://github.com/k-alari/SPRT. 

The modifed version of the applet is available at https://kalari.shinyapps.io/SPRT_binary/
